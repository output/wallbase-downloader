Wallbase Downloader
===================
This is a simple script I use together with a cron job to pull pics for my lockscreen.

For the scraping part of it I use https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ultimate-web-scraper

##License
[MIT](https://github.com/victorhaggqvist/wallbase-downloader/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), Use it for whatever you want! Just be aware of that it will most likely break if wallbase changes their layout.
