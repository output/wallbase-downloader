#Wallbase Downloader
This is a simple script I use together with a cron job to pull pics for my lockscreen.

For the scraping part of it I use https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ultimate-web-scraper

##License
Use it for whatever you want! Just be aware of that it will most likely break if wallbase changes their layout.
